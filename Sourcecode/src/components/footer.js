                  Contract management software automates the creation, tracking,
                  and monitoring of contracts. Professionals, such as
                  salespeople or account representatives, who are involved in
                  the negotiation aspect of contracting are tasked with defining
                  terms and service level agreements, amending agreements, and
                  executing contracts. Legal departments on both sides of a deal
                  participate in the contracting process to ensure compliance
                  with laws and regulations as well as with internal company
                  rules.
